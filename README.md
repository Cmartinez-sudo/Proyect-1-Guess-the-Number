## Project Description
For this project, I have created a little game called Guess the Number. This is a simple game about, yep, you guessed it, guessing a number... I have written a code where a random number is generated from a range of numbers and I will give you a number of tries for you to guess that number.
Let's play!

## Rules
The rules are very simple:
Just answer exactly what the game is asking you, and when guessing the number please use only numbers! _(Example: 5 10 30)_

## Workflow
My workflow was very simple.
First I had to research about the game, how it's played and the foundation of it. Once I knew, I started defining and organizing tasks to be done for the project. The main tasks were structuring the code, programming and error hadling. Once those tasks were done I did some testing and prepared for the presentation of this project.

## Organization
I organized my work with Project Management Boards from Trello for organization and worflow.
Github for repository of Jupyter Notebooks and ReadMe files.
Google Presentation for slides.
